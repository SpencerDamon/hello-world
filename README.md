Hello world introduction
Hi everyone, my name is Spencer Damon. 
I am learning to code to initiate a career change, with a current (as to not limit my options here) eyeball target of Co-star.
My interests are in Full Stack Dev, Android Dev, anything that is OpenSource, Linux, and Hellenistic Astrology.
I am currently learning Kotlin via the Google Associate Android Dev course and HTTP via FreeCodeCamp. I am addicted to learning new things!!!
I am looking to collaborate on anything at entry level, newb material please. 
You can reach me at mailto:spencerdamon1974@gmail.com
