Hi everyone, I am pretty new to the field, but have been putting in some serious hours
learning to code, and wokrking on starting a career as a Junior Android Developer.
My interests are in Android Dev, Software Engineering, as I love problem solving with Kotlin!
I am currently learning Kotlin via the Google Associate Android Dev course and 
Kotlin Basics at the JetBrains Academy.  

I am looking to collaborate on anything at entry junior level material please.
