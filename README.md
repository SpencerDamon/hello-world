# Hello, World! I'm Spencer Damon
Hi everyone, I am pretty new to the field, but have been putting in some serious hours
learning to code, back to school as an undergraduate, and wokrking on a career pivot from farming 
for 15 years to aspiring to become an Android Developer.
My interests are in Android Dev, Kotlin, and Software Engineering, I love problem solving, and
learning new things all the time!
I am currently learning Kotlin via the Google Associate Android Dev course and 
Kotlin Basics at the JetBrains Academy.  

I am looking to collaborate on anything at entry/junior level.
